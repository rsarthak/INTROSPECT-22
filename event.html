                <p style="color: black;">  While the arena of public policy is highly connected to our everyday lives, the students often lack pathways in which they can apply their education and policy ideas and integrate the policy in theory with its practicality.

                  An extremely awaited event in the diverse lineup for Introspect 2021, it is not only a step towards instilling a sense of policy making in students but also welcoming fresh and politically enlightened minds to become key participants in co-analyzing and co-solving this crucial and often unattended issue of India's education sector.

                  <br> <strong>Topic: Budget 2022 : A pathway to Digital Education</strong><br/>

                  We are living in unprecedented times as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak. In the case of India, it has not only posed a challenge to the healthcare system but has severely affected the education system as well. While the education institutes remained closed during the period of lockdown, the question of digital education came to the forefront of all discussions in the light of ensuring seamless learning during the pandemic. The Government of India has increased the budget allocation for the Education sector from Rs 93,224 crore in 2021-22 to Rs 1.04 lakh crore in 2022-23, thus increasing it by 11.86% in order to emphasize digital modes of learning. A digital university, 750 virtual labs to enhance thinking skills in science and mathematics and expansion of the "One Class, One TV Channel" programme under the PM e-VIDYA scheme are among the initiatives that will be implemented in the coming year.

                  In 2020, the Government launched the PM e-Vidya scheme to promote online education across universities in the country. In the Budget 2022-23, it was proposed that the ‘One Class One TV Channel’ programme under this scheme would see an increase in the number of channels from the existing 20 to about 200. However, the overall allocation for the PM e-Vidya scheme has dropped from Rs. 50 crore in 2021-22 (BE) to Rs 10 lakh for 2022-23 (BE). 
                  
                  Several studies conducted during the pandemic have reflected on the prevailing digital divide as a consequence of the absence of high-speed internet facilities, the dearth of electronic devices and poor infrastructure in terms of access to electricity, study spaces and stationery. As per the data by TRAI (Oct-Dec 2020), the number of internet subscribers per 100 inhabitants in rural areas was 35 in comparison to 103 in urban areas. Gender disparity also comes into play in the case of access to smartphones and technology. In a recent survey of 733 students studying in government schools in Bihar, only 28% of the girls had smartphones in their homes, in contrast to 36% of the boys. Online learning has also accentuated caste inequality as about 89.3% of Scheduled Tribes and 85.7% of Scheduled Caste households whose children were in school did not have access to the internet whereas for Forward Castes it was 64.9%. A survey by an NGO Swabhiman in association with the National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People indicated that 73% of the students with disabilities had concerns regarding the availability of study material in appropriate formats.
                  
                  Given the size of the Indian Population and diversity across gender lines, caste lines and regional disparities, What can be a possible way to deal with this contemporary problem? Is a hybrid model of education a need of the hour? Digital empowerment of students is an essential effort and not a mere choice. Policy hackathon seeks to find digitally empowering solutions for societal settings like India to deal with the extension of education at the school level. It is inclined towards finding creative answers to the questions like how to make education more inclusive in terms of caste, region, language, gender and economic group? It was a challenge to continue with the Mid-day meal scheme amidst the Pandemic. This reflected badly on the health of millions of children dependent upon the scheme for nutrition. If digital education emerges as an exercise, how would this scheme be altered for the then circumstances? Or How can the present government initiatives be polished for better resolution of the purpose? Will the budget of 2022-23 be able to bridge the digital gap in education? The purpose of this policy hackathon is to answer some questions that can solve some societal issues when it comes to providing digitally transformed education to all students.
